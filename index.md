## Summary

Seeking a role that approaches the frontend as an engineering task of building a performant, well-structured UI for consumer consumption.
Though I am a front-end developer by day, I have put pen to paper during the design process, been completely lost in a full stack environment.

I am an alumnus of PES University Bangalore, graduating with a Bachelors of Engineering in Information Science and Technology. Originally from Rajasthan, but now residing in Bangalore, I'm looking to grow personally and professionally anywhere in the world.

I want to be involved in projects that I can be proud of, join an amazing team and advance my development career. Take some time to look at my work, and if you're interested in helping me make this happen, let's get in touch.
